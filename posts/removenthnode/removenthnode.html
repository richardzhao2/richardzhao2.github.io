	<h1>Remove nth Node From End of List</h1>
	<h4>Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.
	</h4>
	<h5>Example:
		Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
		<br>
		After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.</h5>
	<br>
	<p style='font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>
		I haven't seen much experience with this question (I've never received this question in a hackerrank or interview and haven't seen it
		on any company's glassdoor questions), but I think this is a decent question to get more comfortable with working with linked lists 
		and linked list traversal. Also, one of the methods for the optimal solution is a pretty common technique to use when it comes to questions
		involving traversal and cycle detection. Personally, this is one of my weakest topics and I hate getting these questions for interviews.

		The solution on Leetcode is pretty good in my opinion, but it may be beneficial to see a step by step visualization of their hare and 
		tortoise solution.

				<p>The problem statement is pretty self explanatory. Given some linked list, get rid of the nth node from the back and return the 
					resulting list. There's 2 main ways that I see to do this; both are in O(n) time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first way involves going through the list twice: once to calculate the length, and another to actually remove the node. The 
					second way involves keeping track of 2 positions in our linked list. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='2'  style = 'height: 250px;'>
				<p>
					Let's consider our linked list: <br>
					4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8. <br>
					We want to remove the 2nd node from the back. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Our solution should return the linked list 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 8.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='3' style = 'height: 430px;'>
				<p>As mentioned, the simple solution is go through the linked list twice. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='4' >
				<p> 
					Let's start with our first element '4' and ask ourselves what implications would there be is 4 was a solution. 
					If 4 was part of the solution pair, then it would mean that there must exist 15 somewhere
					else in the array, since 15 + 4 = 19. That is to say, 15 and 4 are <b>complements</b> of one another.
					<br>
					<br>
					In our example array, <b>12</b> and <b>7</b> is the pair that sums to <b>19</b> and are thus complements of one another.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'step' data-step = '5' style = 'height: 300px;'>
				<p>
					<b>We can use the idea of checking only for complements to speed up our solution.</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					Instead of checking every combination, it's enough to check if the array contains an element and its complement. That is, everytime we iterate through
					the array and consider some element, we only need to check if the complement also exists.
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'step' data-step = '6' style = 'height: 380px;'>
				<p>
					Going back to our example, when we consider the element '3', we only have to see if its complement (16) exists in the array. It doesn't,
					so it obviously can't be part of the solution. However, once we reach the element '7,' we check to see if its complement (12) exists. It does,
					so 12 and 7 must be our solution. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>We can reduce the time of checking for a complement to O(1) with a hashtable. </b> (lookup for a hashtable is treated as O(1)). 
					<br>
					<br>
					This is how we can reduce our solution to O(n).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class='step' data-step='7'>
				<p>We introduce a hash table to keep track of what elements we have seen (and thus know to exist). Since at the start we haven't seen any numbers,
					the hash table is blank, and we assume nothing about the existence of a element's complement.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='8'>
				<p>Start with our first element 4 -- 4's complement (15) is not in our hashtable (so for now we assume it doesn't exist), so we don't have our solution. 
					We have now seen the #4 and need to record that, so we insert it into our hash table.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='9'>
				<p>Now we go to 3 -- again, 3's complement (16) is not in our hashtable. we have now seen 3 and record that, so we insert it into our hash table.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='10'>
				<p>Now we go to 5 -- it's complement is 14 and isn't in the hashtable. We record 5 and keep going.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='11'>
				<p>We go to 12 -- 12's complement is 7 and 7 isn't in our hashtable. Remember, even though we personally know 7 is in our array,
					the computer hasn't seen it yet (so to the computer, it doesn't exist yet). We don't have a solution yet, 
					so we record it in our hashtable and keep going.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='12' style = 'height: 380px;'>
				<p>We go to 7. 7's complement is 12, and we (and the computer) have seen 12 before (it's in our hashtable). 
					Because of this, we now have our solution and we didn't have to check every combination. 
					We now know the solution are the array indicies of 7 and 12.

		So hopefully this makes it easier to understand what the Leetcode solution was talking about. This hashtable uses O(n) space since it contains a max of n elements.
		We also have to only iterate through our array once, so our runtime is now O(n). (which is much better than O(n^2)).
