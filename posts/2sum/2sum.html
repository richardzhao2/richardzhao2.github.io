	<h1>Two-Sum</h1>
	<h4>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
		You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
	</h4>
	<h5>Example:

		Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
		<br>
		Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
		<br>
		return [0, 1].</h5>
	<br>
	<p style='font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>
		I think a lot of people start off with doing 2-Sum when they discover Leetcode and other similar websites. I don't
		think
		questions like these are good indicators of how good a programmer someone is, but for whatever reason, every company
		likes to ask
		this style of question in interviews.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style='font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>
		With that being said, I do like this question. It's one of the best and simple examples where there's a very obvious
		brute force answer in O(n^2) that would probably be used if you've never done any of these problems before and a
		clever way to not have
		to check every combination of numbers possible and reduce the complexity to O(n).

				<p>The jist of this problem is basically given some target number, find the pair of numbers that sum up to our
					target. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the sake of brevity, I'm not going to consider the sorted case and the 2-pointers method: I'll save that
					for when I make a post on 3-Sum. If that made no sense to you, don't worry about it for now.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='2'>
				<p>
					Let's consider the array <b>[4,3,5,12,7,1,9]</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					For small arrays/small numbers, it's generally pretty easy to find the answer for any target.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if our target was 19, it's pretty obvious which 2 numbers sum to 19, that being 12 and 7.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, our solution for this would be <b>[3,4]</b> (representing the indicies of our solutions).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='3' style = 'height: 430px;'>
				<p>The naive solution should be quite easy to understand: simply try out every possible pair of numbers until
					we get our target.
				</p>
				<p>
					One implementation of this idea would be to start with 4, then check 3, 5, 12, 7, 1, 9, and then iterate to 3, 
					and check 5, 12, 7, 1, 9, then to 5 and check 12, 7, 1, 9, and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					This solution is obviously very inefficient and slow -- there has to be a better way than checking every
					possible pair. We loop over each element (which is O(n)) and then within each iteration, loop over the remaining 
					elements (which is also O(n)). Thus, our time complexity is O(n^2). <b>Can we do better?</b> 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='4' >
				<p> 
					Let's start with our first element 4 and ask ourselves what implications would there be is 4 was a solution. 
					If 4 was part of the solution, then it would mean that there must exist 15 somewhere
					else in the array, since 15 + 4 = 19. That is to say, 15 and 4 are <b>complements</b> of one another.
					<br>
					<br>
					In our example, 12 and 7 is the winning combination and are thus complements of one another other.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'step' data-step = '5' style = 'height: 300px;'>
				<p>
					<b>We can use the idea of checking only for complements to speed up our solution.</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					Instead of checking every combination, it's enough to check if the array contains an element and its complement. That is, everytime we iterate through
					the array and consider some element, we only need to check if the complement also exists instead of checking if a pair sums to a target.
					<br>
					<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'step' data-step = '6' style = 'height: 380px;'>
				<p>
					Going back to our example, when we consider the element '3', we only have to see if its complement (16) exists in the array. It doesn't,
					so it obviously can't be part of the solution. However, once we reach the element '7,' we check to see if its complement (12) exists. It does,
					so 12 and 7 must be our solution. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>We can reduce the time of checking for a complement to O(1) with a hashtable. </b> (lookup for a hashtable is treated as O(1)). 
					<br>
					<br>
					This is how we can reduce our solution to O(n).
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class='step' data-step='7'>
				<p>We introduce a hash table to keep track of what elements we have seen (and thus know to exist). Since at the start we haven't seen any numbers,
					the hash table is blank, and we assume nothing about the existence of a element's complement.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='8'>
				<p>Start with our first element 4 -- 4's complement (15) is not in our hashtable (so for now we assume it doesn't exist), so we don't have our solution. 
					We have now seen the #4 and need to record that, so we insert it into our hash table</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='9'>
				<p>Now we go to 3 -- again, 3's complement (16) is not in our hashtable. we have now seen 3 and record that, so we insert it into our hash table</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='10'>
				<p>Now we go to 5 -- it's complement is 14 and isn't in the hashtable. We record it</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='11'>
				<p>We go to 12 -- 12's complement is 7 and 7 isn't in our hashtable. we don't have a solution yet, so we record it in our hashtable and keep going</p>
			</div>
			<div class='step' data-step='12'>
				<p>We go to 7. 7's complement is 12, and we have seen 12 before (it's in our hashtable). 
					Because of this, we now have our solution without having to check every combination. 
					We now know the solution are the indicies of 7 and 12.
