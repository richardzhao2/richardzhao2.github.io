        Boogaloo</h1>

    <b style="font-size: 20px;">TL;DR It's a lot harder this year.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href='../newgrad/newgrad.html'>Last year</a>, I wrote a blog post detailing my new
    grad job search. Well, both offers I had ended up being rescinded
    due to COVID, and I knew I was going to go through the recruiting gauntlet again. I ended up deferring graduation,
    got an
    internship on pretty short-notice (thanks to blatant nepotism), and started recruiting again at the start of August.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now that this year's recruiting cycle is starting to slow down and I've signed somewhere, I wrote this partially to
    give some insight as to the sheer difficulty of recruiting this year (really, it's not you, it's the economy),
    partially to fill my 2020 section with something, but mostly to
    reflect on the insanity of this year, and to gather my thoughts as to why I felt the way I did throughout this
    entire process. Honestly, this is probably more for my own catharsis than anything else, and a bigger chunk of the
    post will probably be on reflecting beyond just the job search, but I hope that some people who feel similar to me
    find
    solace in reading this.

    <u>Statistics:</u><br>
    <b>Companies applied to:</b> 155 <br>
    <b>Responses:</b> 30 <br>
    <b>Hackerranks/Online Assessments/CodeSignal:</b> 27 <br>
    <b>Total Phone Interviews (initial and post-OA):</b> 9 <br>
    <b>Onsites:</b> 6 <br>
    <b>Total Offers: </b> 3 (1 return)<br>
    <b>Withdrawn Applications: </b> 2 <br>

    <br>
    <u>Summary/Takeaways From my Experience:</u><br>
    - <b>This post is really for the neurotic, /r/cscareerquestions dwelling, tech-hub or bust, TC or GTFO kind of
        person. </b> If these don't apply to you, then this probably won't be too relevant, and I applaud your superior
    social awareness and mental health.<br>
    - <b>Recruiting is extra hard this year. </b> I had a higher GPA, more internships, more coursework, more skills
    (well, you get the point - a stronger resume), but last year I had a near 30% response rate where as this year I
    went down to 19%, a big chunk of which were CodeSignal requests, of which I would deem to be "low-quality"
    responses. The companies I applied to were also very similar
    in profile to the ones I applied to last year. <br>
    - <b>Leetcode is pretty essential.</b> Note that I pretty much exclusively applied to Bay Area positions though (due
    to personal reasons). I was asked LC style questions in every interview, many of which were medium/hard
    difficulty.<br>
    - <b>DP does not come up nearly as often as you'd probably think.</b> All of the other "standard" topics (strings,
    linked list, heaps, trees, intervals, greedy, sort, etc.) came up with pretty uniform distribution. <br>
    - <b>Passing or acing an OA does NOT guarantee an interview. </b> This is probably unique to this year and maybe
    next year. I had a CodeSignal of 838 and finished pretty much every OA with all test cases passing and plenty of
    time to spare, but I converted these into an actual interview less than half of the time. Last year, acing an OA
    almost certainly let me advance to at least a phone screen. <br>
    - <b>Virtual career fairs are garbage. </b> <br>
    - <b>Take this post with a grain of salt.</b> This is what worked/didn't work for me, but luck probably played a
    huge part in a lot of my outcomes.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>For context:</u><br>
    <ul>
        <li> - I am <b>not</b> a Computer Science major. (Statistics)
            <ul>
                <li>My response rate was likely lower than that of a typical CS student at CMU.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> - I had 3 internships and a programming instructor job as past experience.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I had not interned at FAANG or
                    at any similar "tiered" companies before. Although I now hate this concept of tiering now, in this
                    regard, my most
                    notable experience was interning at Capital One.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> - My GPA is OK (3.5). It was enough to pass pretty much any cutoff, but I don't think it was anything
            eye-popping.</li>
        <li> I did not use referrals for any application. </li>
    </ul>

    <b style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">The actual job search/preparation</b>
    <p>
        I felt that despite the fact that I was getting noticeably less responses than last year, I still had a decent
        "hit" rate. However, this year, the obstacles I faced last year were exacerbated by the fact that COVID had
        dramatically reduced the number of openings and every opening was getting thousands of applicants. Last year,
        there were so many openings that I couldn't apply fast enough; this year, I could go days or even weeks without
        seeing a new job posted. In addition, I had multiple onsites that were cancelled because headcount filled up -
        even though I had applied the day the job was posted and went through the process as fast as possible. This
        really made me put in perspective how few slots there
        were in comparison to applicants this year. The Robinhood recruiter in particular mentioned that they had over
        <b>50000</b> applications - and there were only 3 university recruiters.
    </p>

    <p>
        My preparation involved skimming CTCI (for behavioral only), grinding a lot of Leetcode, and reading the <a
            href='https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf'>Competitive Programmer's Handbook</a> for more "exotic" topics like
        graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, obscure data structures, etc.. I did 260 questions on Leetcode
        (with a split of 93/146/20)
        over the course of 4 months. I believe that this was overkill; I was basically able to solve any
        technical question thrown at me during an interview with little trouble. The online assessments, however, were a
        different beast. I think this year they were abnormally difficult, as often I was being given insane assessments
        that were essentially 2-3 Leetcode hards in 80 minutes. Prior to this year, I really only encountered this level
        of OA with trading firms, but I was getting this level maybe half the time. Preparing this heavily
        helped me a lot for this particular stage.
    </p>

    <p>
        Honestly, I think
        <a
            href='https://www.teamblind.com/article/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU'>
            the Blind 75 List</a> is enough to handle most of your preparation. Of the online assessments that I've
        taken, the only one I failed to complete was DoorDash's, and of the phone screens and onsites I did not pass,
        the only technical question I failed to answer was a sorting question because I had a brain fart and forgot the
        syntax for writing custom comparators in Python. I also failed a non-trivial amount of behaviorals; essentially
        every phone
        screen that did not progress to an onsite was not because I could not answer the technical question. This was a
        little strange to me, because I usually have little problem with this stage, but I'll chalk that up to my social
        skills deteroriating from not seeing anyone due to COVID, and a generally much higher candidate bar.
    </p>

    <p>
        I began applying at the start of August and sent 155 applications. I applied to almost exclusively the Bay Area
        (around 5% NYC, 2% Seattle, 90% SF/Bay Area, and 3% other). I had a return offer to the startup (based in NYC)
        that I was interning at, so I did not really bother applying to anywhere outside of the Bay Area because I was
        more than willing to take this return offer.
    </p>

    <p>
        This might seem contrary to a lot of what I see on the subreddit, but I did not tailor my application to each
        listing. In fact, I didn't even have a cover letter; I'd submit a blank document if one was required. In my
        experience, cover letters mattered more to smaller firms outside of tech-hubs, but when it came to jobs where
        there were 2k+ applicants, I opted to shotgun.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last year, I was interviewing almost everyday, and had interviews scheduled months in advanced. This year, I
        rarely had interviews and had a very open schedule; I used to get emails requesting an interview pretty much
        everyday and it was honestly quite discouraging to see that I would get an interview request maybe once a week.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of the questions I was asked, I actually ran into a pretty even split when it comes to topics covered. Last
        year, I had been asked mostly tree and interval questions, but now it was pretty evenly distributed. The more
        interesting thing is that I was asked 0 system-design this year - but maybe that's because it's harder to do
        these questions virtually. I'm not entirely sure; it could just be a coincidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        My first onsite that wasn't cancelled was with Tesla in October. I'd actually like to give a special shoutout to
        Tesla for giving me the worst technical interview
        experience I've ever had. My interviewer came in 10 minutes late (to a 45 minute interview), didn't show his
        webcam (probably not that big of a deal, but I personally think this helps to build some kind of relationship
        because I was interviewing to join this person's team and he would be my coworker), didn't say anything to
        introduce himself or what he did
        or even address the fact that he was late,
        immediately pasted a question onto CoderPad and said solve the question, and sat there in absolute silence.
        There was no collaboration, no conversation, no feedback. When I finished the question, he said
        thanks, failed to answer any questions I had, and hung up. I think I heard him talk for 30 seconds. I left with
        the impression that he had 0 intention to hire me in the first place, but the experience was so impersonal and
        bad that I didn't even feel bad after getting the rejection email.
    </p>

    <p>
        I ended up with 3 offers (1 return, 2 unicorns). I'm not entirely sure I want to give out the names of
        these because the rest of this post gets kind of personal, and I'm not sure I want to make it easy to doxx
        myself. I'm sure someone will figure out who I am and what they are, but I'll leave it with, they were 200k
        offers, which was a lot better than either of my rescinded offers.
    </p>

    <b style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Reflecting on this entire experience</b>
    <p>
        I think there's a lot to unpack here, and this really strays away from the actual "job search" experience part
        and goes more into my thoughts throughout the year. If this does not interest you, you should just close the tab
        now,
        but I thought it was important for myself to have an introspection into this
        entire experience, and I have a suspicion that there are a non-trivial amount of people on this subreddit who
        are
        similar enough to me (in both experience and personality) and can hopefully take something away from my 4 AM
        ramblings.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I mentioned at the start of this post, I had multiple offers rescinded due to COVID-19. At the time, I was
        really depressed and devolved into playing video games like 70-80 hours a week. I think what really drove that
        was
        not so much the event of losing my job, but the shame that came with it. I felt like I had let my parents down,
        my
        friends down, and myself down. And more than anything else, I had lost my "proof" that I was not a dumbass.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether they like to admit it or not, CMU (and I suspect many other high-caliber engineering schools) breeds an
        intensely cutthroat culture. Not in the sense of backstabbing one another and withholding knowledge, but in the
        sense that everyone is always competing for something - the best internships, the best grades, the best majors,
        the most classes, fastest graduation time
        the most "CS clout (which is so fucking lame btw)" and it's kind of apparent that as far as the tech side of the
        school is concerned, a lot of respect is derived by how hard you're willing to grind and what companies you get
        offers from. If you willingly try to take a low amount of units, you're perceived as lazy and a lesser human -
        the stress culture is real, and everyone (or maybe its just the loudest are the most apparent) loves to flex how
        smart they are.
    </p>
    <p>
        My most memorable interaction was when me and a couple of friends were just relaxing in one of the CS buildings
        -
        and someone that we knew walked by and started talking to us. Eventually (as every conversation does), it
        devolved into asking about recruiting, and when I mentioned that I was interning at Capital One, he responded
        with -

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>"How on earth did <i>you</i> land an internship at Capital One?"</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        The entire interaction was over in an instant, but my mind just started racing with a bunch of feelings. It was
        a mixture of shock, rage, depression, self-doubt, and a "wow, go fuck yourself." I remember reading someone
        talking about a similar interaction, and he left me with a quote that I think encapsulated exactly what I was
        feeling.

        <br>
        <br>

        "I don’t have a name for this feeling, but I’ll describe it for you. Something happens to you that doesn’t seem
        like a big deal at first. The day goes by and you dwell on it more and more with each passing hour. Before long,
        your day is ruined. Let’s call it the “increasingly unfortunate hindsight emotional trauma due to crappy person
        and interaction feeling."

        <br>
        <br>

        I had a lot of interactions similar in nature to this one with various people, so I'm not sure if it's obvious
        enough yet,
        but yeah, I didn't really like CMU.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a lot of ways, my previous offer meant more than just a job to me. It wasn't just about the money. It was
        about validation. It was about ego. It was about elevating myself above others. It was proof that I was not a
        moron, and more importantly, it was the
        ultimate trump card to refute arrogant morons. In the back of my mind, I would always think something along the
        lines of "you keep acting as if you're superior and I'm a lazy idiot, but look whose making twice what you
        could even think of - I hope it consumes you to see someone work less and do so much better." And in this,
        something much more insidious was breeding inside of me.
        Not only was I deriving all of my self-worth and beliefs of my intelligence from a job (seriously, just think
        about how stupid that sounds) but
        I was
        becoming the very thing that I hated. Whether I liked to admit it or not, I was perpetuating the exact same
        toxic behavior that I passed such heavy judgment on. I had always justified this behavior and entitlement by
        telling myself that I was
        using this "defensively" and not actively belittling others (which was a blatant lie to myself), but whether or
        not I was being aggressive or not about being
        an asshole, I was actively contributing to this entire dynamic of "TC or GTFO", entitled tech-bro, deeming a
        company as trash or not trash kind of shitfest.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think if there's any good thing 2020 has brought me, it's perspective, and dragging my stupid ass back down to
        earth.
        Like, looking back on the me of 6 months ago, I can't believe how stupid and entitled I was. In fact, I bet I
        can look back on this post in another 6 months and think the me of today was a dumbass. People were going
        homeless,
        losing their families, and having the world collapse around them. And here I was, sitting in the comfort of my
        childhood bedroom, with a generous long term internship thinking "it sucks to be me." In hindsight, it's
        absolutely ridiculous how I behaved, but I guess my feelings of shame and insecurity blinded me to seeing the
        bigger picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess what I'm trying to say is, <b>it's rough right now.</b> Any trouble finding a job is not a reflection of
        you or your ability, and a job doesn't (and shouldn't) define who you are. Tying your self-worth to an employer
        will just lead to all kinds of dissatisfaction, and I would venture to say that it is a never ending pursuit to
        find something more to feed that feeling of insecurity.

    </p>
    <p>
        I get that (well, I guess I can't ever truly understand this scenario) paying the bills is necessary, and that
        finding a job's necessary, but I would try to be a little easier on myself. Shit sucks for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've read all the way to the end, then I appreciate it. I'm not sure if I'm 100% prepared to give up some
        of these feelings of spite and rage. Though definitely toxic,
        I cannot deny that they were very effective in motivating me to prepare to such lengths. It reminds me of that
        Michael Jordan meme "and I took that personally," but at the very least I'm aware of it now.

        So that was my 2nd new grad recruiting season - for tech-hub interviews, Leetcode is a must, and the job market is
        rough right now. Though, I'm not sure
        if that's
        what I want readers to take away. I guess I would say to anyone still searching, to be kind and patient to yourself.
    </p>
