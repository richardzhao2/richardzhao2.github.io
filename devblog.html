                    <i>3/1 Game Mechanics</i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p> Outlined some of the mechanics that I want to introduce. The most important feature to implement is something
                similar to Path of Exile's massive passive tree system and its socket and gem system-- namely the ability
                to modify bullets and projectile effects through the use of some kind of modifier. Took some inspiration
                of Cataclysm: DDA and decided to implement their HUD and complexity when it comes to player health and what
                kind of environmental effects the player's character reacts to.
                <br>
                I think the modifier that I really want to see is a combination of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Knockback on hit</li>
                    <li>Multiple Projectiles</li>
                    <li>Chain</li>
                </ul>

                I'll try to experiment with stacking modifiers on top of each other in the upcoming weeks.
                <p>

                            <i>2/23 Sockets and Client-Server</i>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Changed multiplayer architecture to not use the host as a master client and instead have a separate process
                        running the server. I made this change because I thought it'd be easier to resolve user actions if
                        all generation was handled by the server rather than having a client generate everything and have
                        him broadcast all actions. Some of my rationales behind this were:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easier to resolve input from hosts and clients and update accordingly</li>
                            <li>Consistent output (everyone sends to server, receives from server)</li>
                            <li>No perceived host advantage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>This is still subject to change of course; I'm going to have to test out multiplayer capabilities. Since
                        keeping precise and synchronized game states between clients isn't that important, P2P might still
                        be a viable solution.</p>
