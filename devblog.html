                </p>
            </div>
            <p> Put Days Gone By on back burner as far as development goes. I think that pygame is going to be too inefficient
                actually network and code properly, so I'll continue to design it and develop UML diagrams (class, sequence,
                domain model,etc.) and probably port it to Unity once Blood Money is done. Currently working on developing
                clean and responsive feeling lobbies/UI. Art for now is just filler art from previous builds.

            </p>

                    <i>3/1 Game Mechanics</i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p> Outlined some of the mechanics that I want to introduce. The most important feature to implement is something
                similar to Path of Exile's massive passive tree system and its socket and gem system-- namely the ability
                to modify bullets and projectile effects through the use of some kind of modifier. Took some inspiration
                of Cataclysm: DDA and decided to implement their HUD and complexity when it comes to player health and what
                kind of environmental effects the player's character reacts to.
                <br> I think the modifier that I really want to see is a combination of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Knockback on hit</li>
                    <li>Multiple Projectiles</li>
                    <li>Chain</li>
                </ul>

                I'll try to experiment with stacking modifiers on top of each other in the upcoming weeks.

                    <i>2/23 Sockets and Client-Server</i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Changed multiplayer architecture to not use the host as a master client and instead have a separate process running
                the server. I made this change because I thought it'd be easier to resolve user actions if all generation
                was handled by the server rather than having a client generate everything and have him broadcast all actions.
                Some of my rationales behind this were:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easier to resolve input from hosts and clients and update accordingly</li>
                    <li>Consistent output (everyone sends to server, receives from server)</li>
                    <li>No perceived host advantage</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This is still subject to change of course; I'm going to have to test out multiplayer capabilities. Since keeping
                precise and synchronized game states between clients isn't that important, P2P might still be a viable solution.</p>
